/**

 * Any reads or writes scheduled after this method is called will occur over the secured connection.
 * 
 * The possible keys and values for the TLS settings are well documented.
 * Some possible keys are:
 * - kCFStreamSSLLevel
 * - kCFStreamSSLAllowsExpiredCertificates
 * - kCFStreamSSLAllowsExpiredRoots
 * - kCFStreamSSLAllowsAnyRoot
 * - kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain
 * - kCFStreamSSLPeerName
 * - kCFStreamSSLCertificates
 * - kCFStreamSSLIsServer
 * 
 * Please refer to Apple's documentation for associated values, as well as other possible keys.
 * 
 * If you pass in nil or an empty dictionary, the default settings will be used.
 * 
 * The default settings will check to make sure the remote party's certificate is signed by a
 * trusted 3rd party certificate agency (e.g. verisign) and that the certificate is not expired.
 * However it will not verify the name on the certificate unless you
 * give it a name to verify against via the kCFStreamSSLPeerName key.
 * The security implications of this are important to understand.
 * Imagine you are attempting to create a secure connection to MySecureServer.com,
 * but your socket gets directed to MaliciousServer.com because of a hacked DNS server.
 * If you simply use the default settings, and MaliciousServer.com has a valid certificate,
 * the default settings will not detect any problems since the certificate is valid.
 * To properly secure your connection in this particular scenario you
 * should set the kCFStreamSSLPeerName property to "MySecureServer.com".
 * If you do not know the peer name of the remote host in advance (for example, you're not sure
 * if it will be "domain.com" or "www.domain.com"), then you can use the default settings to validate the
 * certificate, and then use the X509Certificate class to verify the issuer after the socket has been secured.
 * The X509Certificate class is part of the CocoaAsyncSocket open source project.
