/**
 * Explanation of Variables (excluding those that are obvious)
 * 
 * fileOffset
 *   This is the number of bytes that have been returned to the connection via the readDataOfLength method.
 *   If 1KB of data has been read from the file, but none of that data has yet been returned to the connection,
 *   then the fileOffset variable remains at zero.
 *   This variable is used in the calculation of the isDone method.
 *   Only after all data has been returned to the connection are we actually done.
 * 
 * readOffset
 *   Represents the offset of the file descriptor.
 *   In other words, the file position indidcator for our read stream.
 *   It might be easy to think of it as the total number of bytes that have been read from the file.
 *   However, this isn't entirely accurate, as the setOffset: method may have caused us to
 *   jump ahead in the file (lseek).
 * 
 * readBuffer
 *   Malloc'd buffer to hold data read from the file.
 * 
 * readBufferSize
 *   Total allocation size of malloc'd buffer.
 * 
 * readBufferOffset
 *   Represents the position in the readBuffer where we should store new bytes.
 * 
 * readRequestLength
 *   The total number of bytes that were requested from the connection.
 *   It's OK if we return a lesser number of bytes to the connection.
 *   It's NOT OK if we return a greater number of bytes to the connection.
 *   Doing so would disrupt proper support for range requests.
 *   If, however, the response is chunked then we don't need to worry about this.
 *   Chunked responses inheritly don't support range requests.
