/**
 * GCDAsyncSocket uses the standard delegate paradigm,
 * but executes all delegate callbacks on a given delegate dispatch queue.
 * This allows for maximum concurrency, while at the same time providing easy thread safety.
 *
 * You MUST set a delegate AND delegate dispatch queue before attempting to
 * use the socket, or you will get an error.
 *
 * The socket queue is optional.
 * If you pass NULL, GCDAsyncSocket will automatically create it's own socket queue.
 * If you choose to provide a socket queue, the socket queue must not be a concurrent queue.
 * If you choose to provide a socket queue, and the socket queue has a configured target queue,
 * then please see the discussion for the method markSocketQueueTargetQueue.
 *
 * The delegate queue and socket queue can optionally be the same.

 * If you need to write data from an immutable buffer, and you need to alter the buffer before the socket

 * Any reads or writes scheduled after this method is called will occur over the secured connection.
 *
 * The possible keys and values for the TLS settings are well documented.

 * trusted 3rd party certificate agency (e.g. verisign) and that the certificate is not expired.
 * However it will not verify the name on the certificate unless you
 * give it a name to verify against via the kCFStreamSSLPeerName key.
 * The security implications of this are important to understand.
 * Imagine you are attempting to create a secure connection to MySecureServer.com,
 * but your socket gets directed to MaliciousServer.com because of a hacked DNS server.
 * If you simply use the default settings, and MaliciousServer.com has a valid certificate,
 * the default settings will not detect any problems since the certificate is valid.
 * To properly secure your connection in this particular scenario you
 * should set the kCFStreamSSLPeerName property to "MySecureServer.com".
 * If you do not know the peer name of the remote host in advance (for example, you're not sure
 * if it will be "domain.com" or "www.domain.com"), then you can use the default settings to validate the

/**
 * Traditionally sockets are not closed until the conversation is over.
 * However, it is technically possible for the remote enpoint to close its write stream.
 * Our socket would then be notified that there is no more data to be read,
 * but our socket would still be writeable and the remote endpoint could continue to receive our data.
 *
 * The argument for this confusing functionality stems from the idea that a client could shut down its
 * write stream after sending a request to the server, thus notifying the server there are to be no further requests.
 * In practice, however, this technique did little to help server developers.
 *
 * To make matters worse, from a TCP perspective there is no way to tell the difference from a read stream close
 * and a full socket close. They both result in the TCP stack receiving a FIN packet. The only way to tell
 * is by continuing to write to the socket. If it was only a read stream close, then writes will continue to work.
 * Otherwise an error will be occur shortly (when the remote end sends us a RST packet).
 *
 * In addition to the technical challenges and confusion, many high level socket/stream API's provide
 * no support for dealing with the problem. If the read stream is closed, the API immediately declares the
 * socket to be closed, and shuts down the write stream as well. In fact, this is what Apple's CFStream API does.
 * It might sound like poor design at first, but in fact it simplifies development.
 *
 * The vast majority of the time if the read stream is closed it's because the remote endpoint closed its socket.
 * Thus it actually makes sense to close the socket at this point.
 * And in fact this is what most networking developers want and expect to happen.
 * However, if you are writing a server that interacts with a plethora of clients,
 * you might encounter a client that uses the discouraged technique of shutting down its write stream.
 * If this is the case, you can set this property to NO,
 * and make use of the socketDidCloseReadStream delegate method.
 *
 * The default value is YES.

/**
 * GCDAsyncSocket maintains thread safety by using an internal serial dispatch_queue.
 * In most cases, the instance creates this queue itself.
 * However, to allow for maximum flexibility, the internal queue may be passed in the init method.
 * This allows for some advanced options such as controlling socket priority via target queues.
 * However, when one begins to use target queues like this, they open the door to some specific deadlock issues.
 *
 * For example, imagine there are 2 queues:
 * dispatch_queue_t socketQueue;
 * dispatch_queue_t socketTargetQueue;
 *
 * If you do this (pseudo-code):
 * socketQueue.targetQueue = socketTargetQueue;
 *
 * Then all socketQueue operations will actually get run on the given socketTargetQueue.
 * This is fine and works great in most situations.
 * But if you run code directly from within the socketTargetQueue that accesses the socket,
 * you could potentially get deadlock. Imagine the following code:
 *
 * - (BOOL)socketHasSomething
 * {
 *     __block BOOL result = NO;
 *     dispatch_block_t block = ^{
 *         result = [self someInternalMethodToBeRunOnlyOnSocketQueue];
 *     }
 *     if (is_executing_on_queue(socketQueue))
 *         block();
 *     else
 *         dispatch_sync(socketQueue, block);
 *
 *     return result;
 * }
 *
 * What happens if you call this method from the socketTargetQueue? The result is deadlock.
 * This is because the GCD API offers no mechanism to discover a queue's targetQueue.
 * Thus we have no idea if our socketQueue is configured with a targetQueue.
 * If we had this information, we could easily avoid deadlock.
 * But, since these API's are missing or unfeasible, you'll have to explicitly set it.
 *
 * IF you pass a socketQueue via the init method,
 * AND you've configured the passed socketQueue with a targetQueue,
 * THEN you should pass the end queue in the target hierarchy.
 *
 * For example, consider the following queue hierarchy:
 * socketQueue -> ipQueue -> moduleQueue
 *
 * This example demonstrates priority shaping within some server.
 * All incoming client connections from the same IP address are executed on the same target queue.
 * And all connections for a particular module are executed on the same target queue.
 * Thus, the priority of all networking for the entire module can be changed on the fly.
 * Additionally, networking traffic from a single IP cannot monopolize the module.
 *
 * Here's how you would accomplish something like that:
 * - (dispatch_queue_t)newSocketQueueForConnectionFromAddress:(NSData *)address onSocket:(GCDAsyncSocket *)sock
 * {
 *     dispatch_queue_t socketQueue = dispatch_queue_create("", NULL);
 *     dispatch_queue_t ipQueue = [self ipQueueForAddress:address];
 *
 *     dispatch_set_target_queue(socketQueue, ipQueue);
 *     dispatch_set_target_queue(iqQueue, moduleQueue);
 *
 *     return socketQueue;
 * }
 * - (void)socket:(GCDAsyncSocket *)sock didAcceptNewSocket:(GCDAsyncSocket *)newSocket
 * {
 *     [clientConnections addObject:newSocket];
 *     [newSocket markSocketQueueTargetQueue:moduleQueue];
 * }
 *
 * Note: This workaround is ONLY needed if you intend to execute code directly on the ipQueue or moduleQueue.
 * This is often NOT the case, as such queues are used solely for execution shaping.

/**
 * It's not thread-safe to access certain variables from outside the socket's internal queue.
 *
 * For example, the socket file descriptor.
 * File descriptors are simply integers which reference an index in the per-process file table.
 * However, when one requests a new file descriptor (by opening a file or socket),
 * the file descriptor returned is guaranteed to be the lowest numbered unused descriptor.
 * So if we're not careful, the following could be possible:
 *
 * - Thread A invokes a method which returns the socket's file descriptor.
 * - The socket is closed via the socket's internal queue on thread B.
 * - Thread C opens a file, and subsequently receives the file descriptor that was previously the socket's FD.
 * - Thread A is now accessing/altering the file instead of the socket.
 *
 * In addition to this, other variables are not actually objects,
 * and thus cannot be retained/released or even autoreleased.
 * An example is the sslContext, of type SSLContextRef, which is actually a malloc'd struct.
 *
 * Although there are internal variables that make it difficult to maintain thread-safety,
 * it is important to provide access to these variables
 * to ensure this class can be used in a wide array of environments.
 * This method helps to accomplish this by invoking the current block on the socket's internal queue.
 * The methods below can be invoked from within the block to access
 * those generally thread-unsafe internal variables in a thread-safe manner.
