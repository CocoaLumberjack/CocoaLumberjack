/**
 * This class provides a logger for the Apple System Log facility.
 *
 * As described in the "Getting Started" page,
 * the traditional NSLog() function directs it's output to two places:
 *
 * - Apple System Log
 * - StdErr (if stderr is a TTY) so log statements show up in Xcode console
 *
 * To duplicate NSLog() functionality you can simply add this logger and a tty logger.
 * However, if you instead choose to use file logging (for faster performance),
 * you may choose to use a file logger and a tty logger.
